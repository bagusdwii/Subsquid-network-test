<summary>On Windows</summary>

1. Enable [Hyper-V](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v).
2. Install [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).
3. Install NodeJS LTS using the [official installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
4. Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

In all installs it is OK to leave all the options at their default values. You will need a terminal to complete this tutorial - [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) bash is the preferred option.

<summary>On Mac</summary>

1. Install [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).
2. Install Git using the [installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/) or by [other means](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).
3. Install NodeJS LTS using the [official installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

We recommend configuring NodeJS to install global packages to a folder owned by an unprivileged account. Create the folder by running
```bash
mkdir ~/global-node-packages
```
then configure NodeJS to use it
```bash
npm config set prefix ~/global-node-packages
```
Make sure that the folder `~/global-node-packages/bin` is in `PATH`. That allows running globally installed NodeJS executables from any terminal. Here is a one-liner that detects your shell and takes care of setting `PATH`:
```
CURSHELL=`ps -hp $$ | awk '{print $5}'`; case `basename $CURSHELL` in 'bash') DEST="$HOME/.bash_profile";; 'zsh') DEST="$HOME/.zshenv";; esac; echo 'export PATH="${HOME}/global-node-packages/bin:$PATH"' >> "$DEST"
```
Alternatively you can add the following line to `~/.zshenv` (if you are using zsh) or `~/.bash_profile` (if you are using bash) manually:
```
export PATH="${HOME}/global-node-packages/bin:$PATH"
```

Re-open the terminal to apply the changes.

<summary>On Linux</summary>

Install [NodeJS (v16 or newer)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager), Git and Docker using your distro's package manager.

We recommend configuring NodeJS to install global packages to a folder owned by an unprivileged account. Create the folder by running
```bash
mkdir ~/global-node-packages
```
then configure NodeJS to use it
```bash
npm config set prefix ~/global-node-packages
```
Make sure that any executables globally installed by NodeJS are in `PATH`. That allows running them from any terminal. Open the `~/.bashrc` file in a text editor and add the following line at the end:
```
export PATH="${HOME}/global-node-packages/bin:$PATH"
```
Re-open the terminal to apply the changes.
